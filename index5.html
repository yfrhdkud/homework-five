        <article> school strives to enhance a child’s physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development in
            the most
            crucial years of their child’s growth. We encourage children to inculcate a positive attitude towards
            learning, which
            will hold them in good stead throughout life. To meet this goal, it is essential to help children set
            realistic goals
            and undertake challenges in school that would hone their skills.</article>

        <h1>WHAT WE ARE</h1>
        <br>
        <h3<p>Sanskriti school’s distinct tradition, culture of innovation and indomitable school spirit, provides a
            fertile learning
            field for the New Age Child. Sanskriti school is an inclusive school where we have students of varying
            abilities with
            personalised attention. The teacher’s role is more to inspire than to teach – to be a facilitator, role
            model and a
            guide.


            Creating a quality learning environment involves everyone – parents, students, teachers, support staff and
            volunteers,
            each bringing a unique perspective and contribution towards fulfilling the school’s philosophy. They are
            essential
            ingredients of our school’s continuing success.</p>
